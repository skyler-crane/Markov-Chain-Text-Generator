# Markov-Chain-Text-Generator
## Description
This program uses Markov Chain to generate text based on a source text. 
After reading the source text, the program assigns to each word probabilities about what the next word will be.
The result is most often nonsensicle, but a fun look into the language of the source.

## Instructions
To run this program, all you have to do is enter the following in the command-line:
#### python3 markov.py file [-w words]
Examples:

`python3 markov.py demo1.txt`

`python3 markov.py demo2.txt -w 30`
